# Music Player Website
This project is a responsive web application designed for playing a collection of music tracks. Built using HTML5, CSS (Bootstrap 5), and JavaScript, it offers the following features:

1. Play Music: Click on any listed song title to play the corresponding audio track.
2. Dynamic Playback: The selected song starts playing with autoplay and can be controlled using standard audio controls.
3. Visual Feedback: Displays the currently playing song dynamically in a dedicated section.
4. Responsive Design: Utilizes Bootstrap for a responsive layout, ensuring compatibility across devices.
This project is ideal for exploring front-end web development techniques, event handling in JavaScript, and integrating multimedia elements into web applications.
